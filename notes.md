# Concate-what

## Main takeaways

- Concatenative: What, How, Why
- Consequences of syntax
- How learning a new language influenced specifically my JS programming

## Outline

### Intro & Hello (1min)

### What, how, why (5min)

- Journey between JS and Ait
- Concatenative - the definition
- Example: divisible by 5 with stack
- Concatenative languages
  - Forth
  - Joy
  - PostScript
  - Factor
  - EDSLs
  - VMs
  - Ait

### Consequences of syntax (10min)

- Composition as a mechanism
  - Sub-programs
  - Data-flow
  - Uniform interfaces
- Reusability/DRY
  - Your approach to reusability changes when you don't have variables
  - You think in terms of what is known when rather than what would I maybe like to change in the future
  - Redefining is easy
  - You get currying for free\*
- Naming things becomes even more important
  - Naming things is essentially free
  - Same with factoring

### Learning new languages (summary) (4min)

- Learning new languages, especially ones with wildly different design than what you are used to makes you approach programming differently
- Thinking in terms of composability changes how you work
- Maybe parameterizing everything isn't the way to go?
- Having the wrong abstraction hurts
- Configurability is complexity - make sure it's worth it
