## Abstract

One way to become a more versatile and adaptable programmer is to learn a new way to look at programming — a new programming paradigm. This is the story of my head first dive into the weird world of Concatenative Programming and how it affected my view on JavaScript and programming in general.

## Description

Being able to look at a problem from multiple angels, envision new kinds of solutions, gaining new insight into how we program — these are some of the side effects of learning new programming languages and paradigms. Often it is the languages and paradigms least likely to show up in your day to day programming that gives you the most interesting insights and ideas.

Once upon a time I stumbled upon the weird and wonderful world of Concatenative Programming. A family of programming languages unlike anything I had seen, with syntax reminiscent of 90s eurodance anthems and the wild idea that everything is a function — even the values. This is the story about my journey into that world, what I learned and how it changed my views on JavaScript and programming in general.
